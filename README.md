# Flask

[What is flask according to duck?](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=flask&t=ffab&atb=v192-1&ia=web)

## April Fool's joke
> Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.
According to Ronacher, the idea was originally an April Fool's joke that was popular enough to make into a serious
application.
>
> When Ronacher and Georg Brandl created a bulletin board system written in Python,
>the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja were developed.
>
> Flask has become popular among Python enthusiasts.
> As of October 2020, it has second most stars on GitHub among Python web-development frameworks,
only slightly behind Django, and was voted the most popular web framework in the Python Developers Survey 2018.

## Flask is minimal, Django is huge
* But both are popular: [Flask](https://stackshare.io/flask) vs [Django](https://stackshare.io/django)
* Flask is easier to gasp

## Prerequisites
* Knowledge about python virtualenv
* Knowledge about python modules
* Knowledge about environment variables

## Let's run it
* In Console  
* And pyCharm

* `python main.py`
* `FLASK_APP=main flask run`

### Test different ports
[How](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/cli/#setting-command-options)

#### In source file (pyCharm run)
Like `app.run(port=5001)`

#### In console
* `FLASK_APP=main flask run --port 5002`
* `FLASK_APP=main FLASK_RUN_PORT=5002 flask run`


### Make it work as a script
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### But What does `if __name__ == “__main__”`: do?
